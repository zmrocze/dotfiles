# Insufficient testing can impact correctness

TODO: I'd say that this actually can result in broken features and vulns, I feel it could be LOW and have a proper score.

## Description

TODO: Elaboraste on 'spending collected fees'.
There are no tests asserting the correctness for spending collected fees. 
Protocol fees get sent to the `Collector` script to then get distributed to indy stakers. Distributing is not tested in the current test suite. Thus the validation logic of the `Collector` script with the `Collect` redeemer and the one of `Staking Manager` with the `Distribute` redeemer doesn't get executed durings tests.

## Recommendation

TODO: Any concrete test in mind?
Add tests attempting to steal collected fees and tests for the distribution of collected fees to Indy stakers.

TODO: Add references to all things mentioned above.
