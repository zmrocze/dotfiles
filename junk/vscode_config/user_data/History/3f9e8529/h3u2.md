Plutip has executable 'local-cluster' starting a cluster of 3 pools and a relay node.
One should:
 - start cluster with `cabal new-run local-cluster` and copy shown node socket
 - navigate to cluster-data and run:
 ```
 export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<socket path>

 # submit update-proposal bumping major version to 7 (babbage)
 

 ```
