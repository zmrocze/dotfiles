Profiling capabilities right now exist in the form of uplc evaluate executable (https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/howtos/profiling-scripts.html ).

Only whats inconvenient is the journey from the written validator through serialization to the viewable output of flamegraph. 
Small quality of life improvement would be to provide helper function that goes immedietely from `CompiledCode` to the svg viewable file.
User would need still to fully apply his validator (provide ScriptContext, Redeemer, Datum), before being able to profile it.

A profiling ability could be built into plutip (most likely possible), to get profiling info for scripts as they are executed on chain. For user this means that he doesn't need to create reasonable ScriptContext, but his repl loop needs to be waited for longer to run.
