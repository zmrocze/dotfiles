This format is based on [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0).


## Unreleased (Plutip-Core)
- No functionality to run test contracts with `Plutip.Contract`
- No setup for BPI from cluster setup

- No tracer in ClusterEnv
- No collateral utxo initialization in `local-cluster`
- No `relayNodeLogs`, `chainIndexMode`, `budgetMultiplier`, `extraSigners` parameters in `PlutipConfig`
- No `NegativeLovelaces` in `ClusterStartupFailureReason`
- Moved saving keys into 'signing-keys' (before: 'bot-plutus-interface/signing-keys')
- New: withFundedCluster, withCluster (previously withPlutusInterface)

## [1.3.1] - 2022-11-04

### Fixed

- collateral creation - happens now before user contract execution

### Added

- collateral handling documentation

## [1.3.0] - 2022-10-26

### Added

- control on `chain-index` launch
  - `chainIndexPort` in `PlutipConfig` replaced with `chainIndexMode :: ChainIndexMode`
  - `local-cluster` options added: `--chain-index-port`, `--no-index`

## [1.2.1] - 2022-10-25

### Fixed

- eDSL function to await till wallet is funded `awaitWalletFunded`

### Added

- package with example of how to execute arbitrary contract on private network from Haskell

## [1.2.0] - 2022-10-21

### Added

- `Plutip` configuration
  - Ability to set slot length and epoch size
  - Ability to add custom keys constant across runs, e.g. to use them as extra signers
  - Ability to set custom file where relay node log can be saved after tests run
  - Ability to set to set custom port for `chain-idex`
  - Ability to set custom directory for cluster data files
  - Ability to set the working directory of the node, chain index and BPI. Also specify if said directory should be cleared after cluster stops.
  - Ability to set budget multiplier on estimated budget for rare case of incorrect estimation
- Default cluster data files delivered via `data-files` package property
- Contract execution result returns current contract state for failure cases too
- Implementing tasty integration
  - Group together contract executions inside a common cluster using `withCluster`
  - Construct test cases from initial wallet distribution, contracts and assertions with `assertExecution`
  - Display contract execution logs with `assertExecutionWith` with tracing options
  - Run multiple contracts in sequence using `withContract` and `withContractAs`
  - Assertions for testing contract execution result (success and failures) and contract state:
    - `shouldSucceed`
    - `shouldFail`
    - `shouldYield`
    - `yieldSatisfies`
    - `stateIs`
    - `stateSatisfies`
    - `shouldThrow`
    - `errorSatisfies`
    - `failReasonSatisfies`
  - Assertions for testing contract execution budget
    - `overallBudgetFits`
    - `assertOverallBudget`
    - `budgetsFitUnder`
  - Combining arbitrary assertions together
  - Building arbitrary assertions with `Predicate`  
  - Initialising wallets and asserting them after contract execution:
    - `initAda`
    - `initLovelace`
    - `initAndAssertAda`
    - `initAndAssertAdaWith`
    - `initAndAssertLovelace`
    - `initAndAssertLovelaceWith`
    - `initAdaAssertValue`
    - `initAdaAssertValueWith`
    - `initLovelaceAssertValue`
    - `initLovelaceAssertValueWith`
    - `withCollateral`
