# Schnorr signatures

## Intro

My aim with is to explain Schnorr signatures, but in a way that doesn't make it look like an arbitral scheme. 
We are going to split the explanation into modular parts.

## Discrete logarithm

We are going to do calculations in modular arithmetic. But really the fact that it's modular arithmetic is an implementation detail.
We need a finite group G, where the discrete logarithm problem is hard. What is a group: [short reminder](#short-reminder-on-what-a-group-is) and [thorough explanation]().

### Short reminder on what a group is
It is an algebraic structure with a single binary operation. The operation has a neutral element
