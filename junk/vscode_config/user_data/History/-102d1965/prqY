# Schnorr signatures

## Intro

My aim with is to explain Schnorr signatures, but in a way that doesn't make it look like an arbitral scheme. 
We are going to split the explanation into modular parts.

 - discrete logarithm
 - zero knowledge protocols

## Discrete logarithm

We are going to do calculations in modular arithmetic. But really the fact that it's modular arithmetic is an implementation detail.
We need a finite group G, where the discrete logarithm problem is hard. Reminder: a group is a structure with For
