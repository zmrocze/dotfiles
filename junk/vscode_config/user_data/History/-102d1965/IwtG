# Schnorr signatures

## Intro

My aim with is to explain Schnorr signatures, but in a way that doesn't make it look like an arbitral scheme. 
We are going to split the explanation into modular parts.

 - discrete logarithm
 - zero knowledge protocols
 - fiat-shamir heurestic

## Discrete logarithm

We are going to do calculations in
