# Missing integration tests with the real Cardano environment risks unexpected issues during deployment

| Severity | CVSS | Vulnerability type  |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| None     | 0.0  | not-a-vulnerability |

## Description

Currently, Indigo's test suite uses the [Plutus Simple Model](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) testing framework, which is similar to emulator traces and is used to estimate program resource usage and assert correctness conveniently and quickly.

However, testing and running Plutus programs in a real Cardano network is essential as various issues can arise when dealing with not deterministic parts of the blockchain like contention, slot timing, block validation, etc.

## How to reproduce

N/A

## Recommendation

Test the Indigo Plutus program behaviour using any of the available integration test frameworks, specifically [Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) or using [CTL integration with Plutip](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/blob/develop/doc/plutip-testing.md).
