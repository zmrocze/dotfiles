    { % Description 
    Proper documentation is crucial to avoid introducing new bugs in the future.
Codebase generally contains little comments, but the consistent namings and module structure together with self-commenting validator checks make it a lesser problem.
Following are issues that could be improved still:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RecordEpochToScaleToSum endpoint is missing from the yellowpaper
    \item Minimal collateral ratio is passed in code as a percentage. This is undocumented both in the types and functions using it.
    \item `sessSnapshot` field is confusingly named. Elsewhere "snapshot" refers to values with `StabilityPoolSnapshot` type.
    \item Implemention of the tests is poorly documented.
  \end{itemize}
