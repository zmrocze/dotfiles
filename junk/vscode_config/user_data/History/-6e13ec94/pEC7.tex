    { % Description 
    If there are two successful proposals, then a user can steal an upgrade token by executing both of the proposals in the same transaction. 

    A passed proposal results in an UTXO with an \texttt{Upgrade Token}. There are pairs of \texttt{Upgrade Tokens} whose validation logic allows for them to be executed simultaneously in a single transaction. For example two \texttt{Text Proposals} or two \texttt{Modify Protocol Params} proposals for the same parameters.
    
    But the validation logic checks precisely for a single \texttt{Upgrade Token} to get burnt. This allows for a transaction spending two \texttt{Upgrade Tokens}, burning one of them as demanded by the validator, but sending the remaining one to a wallet address of an attacker. This is very severe as a user having an upgrade token could execute arbitrary proposals.
    }
    { % How to reproduce / Provided Proof      
    To test for the vulnerability we use two successful \texttt{Text Proposals} and execute them in a single transaction. 

    A \href{https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts/blob/3ceec2538fba0266b75c5e7cadddeae1fb8fb4e6/tests/Spec/Governance/Benchmark.hs#L197}{test} was added in the \texttt{IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts} test suite that demonstrates the attack. To reproduce it's sufficient to run the following steps:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    $ git clone https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts.git
    $ cd smart-contracts
    $ git checkout 3ceec2538fba0266b75c5e7cadddeae1fb8fb4e6
    $ nix develop
    $ cabal run indigo-tests -- --test -- --pattern "Text Exploit Proposal"
    benchmark test suite
      Governance
        Text Exploit Proposal: OK (0.65s)
    All 1 tests passed (0.65s)
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    }
    { % Recommended Fix
    The validation of proposal execution should check for the unique update token in the inputs. Ability to execute multiple proposals at once is more confusing than useful.
