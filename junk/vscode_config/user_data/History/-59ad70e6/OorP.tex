%	\bzI - the indent of the next item (from -10 up to +10)
% 	\bzN - the number used to label the last displayed node
% 	\bzL - the number used to number the last displayed list element
% All these variables are automatically modified, as explained below.

% Here we discuss \bzH.

% \bzOn creates a new slide of the presentation (shortly slide).
% The content of the macro will be visible from that slide onward (On).
