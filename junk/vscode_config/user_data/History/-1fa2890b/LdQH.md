nix functions 
 - onchain: derives script directory
 - offchain: 1. script directory -> derives offchain src with bindings
             2. script bindings -> whole offchain src (its there)


maybe purs bindings generator in onchain? just as convenience, because 'src' derivation for purs project can't depend on purs provided executable (probably?)
