# Audit

## Executive Summary

Most of the audit's findings can be traced to a few underlying issues:

<!--
FIXME

1. The existence of contention at the level of Stability Pool

1. defered validation from one contract of the protocol to another

1. lack of integration testint on the real network.

-->

### Code Coverage

The entirety of the codebase was audited making use of hypothesees formulated on
the technical specification, together with speculative analysis based on
[vulnerability types](#vulnerabilitytypes). For a breakdown of all the
considered hypotheses broken down by module, refer to [issue #498][issue-498],
and subsequent linked issues. For brevity, in the following section we only
include discovered vulnerabilities, leaving the exploration as an external
reference.
