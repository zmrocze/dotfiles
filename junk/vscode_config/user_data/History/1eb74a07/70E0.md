##### Description

If there are two successful proposals, then a user can steal an upgrade token by executing both of the proposals in the same Tx. 

A passed proposal results in an UTXO with an `Upgrade Token`. There are pairs of `Upgrade Tokens` whose validation logic allows for them to be executed simultaneously in a single transaction. For example two `Text Proposals` or two `Modify Protocol Params` proposals for the same parameters. 

Though the validation logic checks precisely for a single `Upgrade Token` to get burnt. This allows for a transaction spending two `Upgrade Tokens`, burning one of them as demanded by the validator, but sending the remaining one to a wallet address of an attacker.
This is very severe because if the user has the upgrade token then they can make arbitrary proposal and execute them.

This is also valid if there are two successful same proposals with all equal values. For eg: two same successful proposals about ModifyProtocolParams that modifies same protocol parameters.

##### How To Reproduce

To test for the vulnerability we need two succesfull text proposals, giving us two upgrade tokens

TODO: To test for the vulnerability it's sufficient to build and submit a full CDP liquidation transaction that burns more of iAsset than it's minted by the frozen CDP.

A [test](https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts/blob/3ceec2538fba0266b75c5e7cadddeae1fb8fb4e6/tests/Spec/Governance/Benchmark.hs#L197) was added in the IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts test suite that demonstrates the attack. To reproduce it's sufficient to run the following steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/smart-contracts.git
$ cd smart-contracts
$ git checkout 3ceec2538fba0266b75c5e7cadddeae1fb8fb4e6
$ nix develop
$ cabal run indigo-tests -- --test -- --pattern "Text Exploit Proposal"
benchmark test suite
  Governance
    Text Exploit Proposal: OK (0.65s)
All 1 tests passed (0.65s)
```
##### Recommendation

The validation of full liquidation transactions should include a check to ensure that the burned iAsset amount doesn't exceed the amount of iAsset minted by the CDP being liquidated.
