# Conclusion

During the 6 week period Mlabs inspected the on-chain code of the Indigo protocol revealing TODO vulnurabilities, TODO of them critical. These enable a malicious actor to burn assets of a `Stability Pool` or compromise the governance part of the protocol by creating fake votes or executing arbitrary proposals. 

We also identified less severe vulnurabilities including contention issues, missing incentives and ones that - while to our knowledge are not exploitable right away - remain risky and could become a problem at the slightest protocol change. Lastly we pinpointed untested validation logic 

The list is not said to be exhaustive, but rather contains the issues identified by the team in the limited timeframe of the audit. Mlabs has summarized the findings in the given report, outlining potential dangers and leaving recommendations. The report is provided without a guarantee of any kind, but we hope it proves useful. Already before the audit conclusion, the Indigo development team has responded with fixes. Mlabs has provided feedback to some of these, but a thorough review needs to be carried out by the responsible Indigo developers.
