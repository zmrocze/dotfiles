- CI check that materialized scripts are up to date with onchain
- ctl runtime
- template doc (outsorcing to ctl doc, but additionaly about the flow of data)
- check out if ply-ctl is something we should use

Q:
- is it a problem that offchain/onchain use different nixpkgs?
- command to e2e bundle/run chosen purescript main module (tired of moving debug test into official main)
- Magnus about tooling/pre-commits
