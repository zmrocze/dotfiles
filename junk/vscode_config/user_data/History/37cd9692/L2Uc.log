Strip down plutip to plutip-core

This change leaves plutip as a tool for spawning local clusters, 
removing all the testing functionalities for testing contracts.

 - remove functionality to run test contracts
 - sync deps to cardano-node-1.35.4
 - remove BPI and plutus-apps from deps
 - remove setup for BPI from cluster setup
 - refactor cluster setup
 - new: withCluster (previously withPlutusInterface), withFundedCluster
 - change module structure
 - keys saved into 'signing-keys' (before: `bot-plutus-interface/signing-keys`)
 - no copying of relay node logs
 - no tracer in ClusterEnv
