# /etc/zshrc: DO NOT EDIT -- this file has been generated automatically.
# This file is read for interactive shells.
#

# Which means that unless you explicitly meticulously override everything
# generated, interactions between your ~/.zshrc and these files are likely
# to be rather surprising.
#
# Note however, that you can disable loading of the generated /etc/zprofile
# and /etc/zshrc (you can't disable loading of /etc/zshenv, but it is
# designed to not set anything surprising) by setting `no_global_rcs` option
# in ~/.zshenv:
#
#   echo setopt no_global_rcs >> ~/.zshenv
